# Designing a plugin experience

These guidelines will help you define the best user experience for your plugin. Based on your users workflow and the plugin action, different UX patterns and UI components should be considered as you create a plugin.

Plugins can interact with the user at different levels, for example, some plugins in some use cases won’t render an interface, and some will include actions that need an interface.

| **Plugins Panel**   | **Plugins Dialog**   |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| Non-Blocking UI - This interface is best used when the user should have access to the canvas while using the plugin.   | Blocking UI - This interface is best used when the plugin needs to run an action and the user shouldn’t modify or change selection of objects on the canvas   |
